ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* AndroidManifest.xml.meta
* bin.meta
* build.xml
* build.xml.meta
* build_plugin.sh
* build_plugin.sh.meta
* gen.meta
* libs.meta
* lint.xml.meta
* local.properties.meta
* proguard-project.txt
* proguard-project.txt.meta
* project.properties.meta
* src.meta

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => sp_unity_open_iab/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* libs/OpenIAB-plugin.jar => sp_unity_open_iab/libs/OpenIAB-plugin.jar
* libs/in-app-purchasing-2.0.1.jar => sp_unity_open_iab/libs/in-app-purchasing-2.0.1.jar
* lint.xml => sp_unity_open_iab/lint.xml
* src/ => sp_unity_open_iab/src/main/java/
* src/es.meta => sp_unity_open_iab/src/main/resources/es.meta
* src/es/socialpoint.meta => sp_unity_open_iab/src/main/resources/es/socialpoint.meta
* src/es/socialpoint/unity.meta => sp_unity_open_iab/src/main/resources/es/socialpoint/unity.meta
* src/es/socialpoint/unity/openiab.meta => sp_unity_open_iab/src/main/resources/es/socialpoint/unity/openiab.meta
* src/es/socialpoint/unity/openiab/UnusedStub.java.meta => sp_unity_open_iab/src/main/resources/es/socialpoint/unity/openiab/UnusedStub.java.meta

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
